# Item List (To-Do List)

You can ADD/EDIT/DELETE/SEARCH items from your list. You can change the background color and change the order of the items too! 

Also, all items will be saved in your Local Storage so you don't lose them when you leave the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Maybe I will use this as a base to make something bigger in the future and add more functionalities.
